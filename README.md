# CS
A toy compiler, with a vm backend.

I wrote this project just for fun, please don't use it in real work.

# Show
It works like a shell: once you type in a sentence, the CS could evaluate it and print the result.
```
Welcome to CS!
CS: int a;
res: a = 0
CS: a = 1 + 1;
res: a = 2
CS: println(a);
2
res: 
CS: exit
```
